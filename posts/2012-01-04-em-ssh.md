#EM-SSH
Em-ssh is a net-ssh adapter for EventMachine. For the most part you can take any net-ssh code you have and run it in the EventMachine reactor.

Em-ssh is not associated with the Jamis Buck's [net-ssh](http://net-ssh.github.com/) library. Please report any bugs with em-ssh to [https://github.com/simulacre/em-ssh/issues](https://github.com/simulacre/em-ssh/issues)

The code is on [Github](http://github.com/simulacre/em-ssh/). The [documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/em-ssh/0.1.0/frames) is on rubydoc.

##Installation

    gem install em-ssh

##Synopsis
<pre>
  <code class="ruby">
EM.run do
  EM::Ssh.start(host, user, :password => password) do |ssh|
    # capture all stderr and stdout output from a remote process
    ssh.exec!('uname -a').tap {|r| puts "\nuname: #{r}"}
  
    # capture only stdout matching a particular pattern
    stdout = ""
    ssh.exec!("ls -l /home") do |channel, stream, data|
      stdout << data if stream == :stdout
    end
    puts "\n#{stdout}"
  
    # run multiple processes in parallel to completion
    ssh.exec('ping -c 1 www.google.com')
    ssh.exec('ping -c 1 www.yahoo.com')
    ssh.exec('ping -c 1 www.rakuten.co.jp')
  
    #open a new channel and configure a minimal set of callbacks, then wait for the channel to finishes (closees).
    channel = ssh.open_channel do |ch|
      ch.exec "/usr/local/bin/ruby /path/to/file.rb" do |ch, success|
        raise "could not execute command" unless success
  
        # "on_data" is called when the process writes something to stdout
        ch.on_data do |c, data|
          $stdout.print data
        end
      
        # "on_extended_data" is called when the process writes something to stderr
        ch.on_extended_data do |c, type, data|
          $stderr.print data
        end
      
        ch.on_close { puts "done!" }
      end
    end
  
    channel.wait

    ssh.close
    EM.stop
  end
end

##Shell
 
Em-ssh provides an expect-like shell abstraction layer on top of net-ssh in EM::Ssh::Shell

### Example
<pre>
 <code class="ruby">
require 'em-ssh/shell'
EM.run {
  EM::Ssh::Shell.new(host, 'caleb', "") do |shell|
    shell.should be_a(EventMachine::Ssh::Shell)
    shell.wait_for(']$')
    shell.send_and_wait('uname -a', ']$')
    shell.wait_for(']$')
    shell.send_and_wait('/sbin/ifconfig -a', ']$')
    timer.cancel
    EM.stop
  end
}
 </code>
</pre>

#### Synchrony Example
<pre>
 <code class="ruby">
require 'em-ssh/shell'
EM.run {
  Fiber.new {
    shell = EM::Ssh::Shell.new(host, 'caleb', '')
    shell.wait_for(']$')
    shell.send_and_wait('sudo su -', 'password for caleb: ')
    shell.send_and_wait('password', ']$')
    output = shell.send_and_wait('/etc/init.d/openvpn restart', ']$')
    # ...
    shell.send_and_wait('exit', ']$')
    shell.send_data('exit')
  }.resume
}
 </code>
</pre>


## Other Examples
See bin/em-ssh for an example of a basic replacement for system ssh.

See bin/em-ssh-shell for a more complex example usage of Shell.
